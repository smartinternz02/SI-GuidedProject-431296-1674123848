Predicting The Unpredictable: A Look Into The World Of Powerlifting
About this Project: Powerlifting is a popular sport. In competition, the impact on powerlifters' performance is mainly due to age, weight, fitness and psychology. Therefore, the training methods of coaches for powerlifters are extremely important, and studying the factors that influence athletes' performance is an inseparable task in training process. based on the powerlifting data in the international competitions; they calculated the score of powerlifters at their peak performance, thereby giving the development trend of athletes, helping experts to evaluate more correctly about the athletes' abilities before playing.

The main objective of this project is to find estimated deadlift for builders.The dataset is downloaded from Kaggle.The dataset has attributes playerId, name, age, equipement ,sex, bodyweight, bestbenchsquat etc. For model building, regression algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision tree, Random forest, and XgBoost will be used. We will train and test the data with these algorithms. From this the best model is selected and saved in pkl format. We will also be deploying our model locally using Flask.
